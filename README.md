Codecademy project for learning dictionaries in Python.
The program creates a list of table top RPG gamers where each gamer is a dictionary with name and available days. Finds the day of the week with highest number of available gamers and prints a text as a substitute of sending e-mail to each. Then does the same for the rest of the gamers(as a day of the week).
